             The cross is thus a sign both of Christ himself and of the faith of Christians.
            <strong style="background-color: white;"> Matthew 16:24-26 KJV :</strong> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
            For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</p>

       <h1>JESUS CHRIST</h1>
       <h4 style="margin-top: 2%;">Our Saviour</h4>
        <p style="text-align: left;  margin-bottom: 3%;">Jesus taught mostly love and forgiveness for others, as well as being humble about one's religion.
             He talked many times about the kingdom of God, and told others, "The kingdom of God has come near.
             He said that one must be mild, like a child, and never boast. He taught that people who ignore God and other people do not deserve his blessing, 
             but God would still forgive them if they repented. Jesus opposed the other Jewish priests because they used religion to boast. 
             Jesus was put on trial and convicted to death by the Jewish leaders, then sent to his execution on a cross by Roman authorities.
